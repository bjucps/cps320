---

## Course Connections

- Applied **requirements gathering** (MSE Ch. 4) while working on project requirements with the music team.
- Practiced **iterative planning** by breaking requirements into user stories for GitHub.
- Used **GitHub and wiki documentation** skills developed in previous IT courses to organize the project repo.
- Began **Django setup**, connecting concepts from **Database (PostgreSQL)** and **Software Engineering classwork** to build a foundation for the app.

## Inspect (Reflection)

I contributed in requirement gathering and initial setup. I was proactive in documenting project requirements and collaborating with the team. Pair programming in class helped me understand how my teammates approach problem-solving. I noticed that estimating hours and breaking down tasks into smaller chunks makes collaboration smoother.

## 🔧 Adapt (Next Sprint)

For the next sprint, I will:

- Take more initiative in writing **tests early** (TDD principles).
- Improve time tracking consistency by logging work immediately after sessions.
- Encourage teammates to rotate pairing partners more frequently to share knowledge better.
